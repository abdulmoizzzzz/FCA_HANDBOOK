The application of the  Principles  is modified for  firms  conducting  MiFID business   13 and  Annex II benchmark administrators 12 .  PRIN 3  (Rules about application) specifies to whom, to what and where the  Principles  apply."},
{"Section": "Application", "ID": "PRIN 1.1.1A", "Dated": "01/08/2019", "Description": "14 The  Principles  also apply to certain  payment service providers  and  electronic money issuers  that are not  firms .  PRIN 3.1.1AR  sets out the application of the  Principles  to these  persons . The references to a  firm  in  PRIN 2  includes such  persons ."},

{"Section": "Link to fit and proper standard", "ID": "PRIN 1.1.4", "Dated": "01/04/2013", "Description": "In substance, the  Principles  express the main dimensions of the \"fit and proper\" standard set for  firms  in  threshold condition  5 (Suitability), although they do not derive their authority from that standard or exhaust its implications. Being ready, willing and organised to abide by the  Principles  is therefore a critical factor in applications for  Part 4A permission , and breaching the  Principles  may call into question whether a  firm  with  Part 4A permission  is still fit and proper."},

{"Section": "Taking group activities into account", "ID": "PRIN 1.1.5", "Dated": "01/08/2019", "Description": "Principles  3 (Management and control), 4 (Financial prudence) and (in so far as it relates to disclosing to the  FCA 11  ) 11 (Relations with regulators) take into account the activities of members of a  firm's  group . Compliance by another  person  to whom the  Principles  apply with  Principles  3, 4 and 11 can also be affected by the activities of other  persons  who are members of their  group . 14  This does not mean that, for example, inadequacy of a  group  member's risk management systems or resources will automatically lead to a  firm  contravening  Principle  3 or 4. Rather, the potential impact of a  group  member's activities (and, for example, risk management systems operating on a  group  basis) will be relevant in determining the adequacy of the  firm's  risk management systems or resources respectively."},

Principle  5 (Market conduct) applies to world-wide activities which might have a negative effect on confidence in the  UK financial system 8 . In considering whether to take regulatory action under these  Principles  in relation to activities carried on outside the  United Kingdom , the  FCA 11   will take into account the standards expected in the market in which the  firm  or other  person  to whom the  Principles  apply 14  is operating.  Principle  11 (Relations with regulators) applies to world-wide activities; in considering whether to take regulatory action under  Principle  11 in relation to cooperation with an overseas regulator, the  FCA 11   will have regard to the extent of, and limits to, the duties owed by the  firm  or other  person 14  to that regulator. ( Principle  4 (Financial prudence) also applies to world-wide activities.)"},

{"Section": "Consequences of breaching the Principles", "ID": "PRIN 1.1.7", "Dated": "01/08/2019", "Description": "Breaching a  Principle  makes a  firm  or other  person  to whom the  Principles  apply 14  liable to disciplinary sanctions. In determining whether a  Principle  has been breached it is necessary to look to the standard of conduct required by the  Principle  in question. Under each of the  Principles  the onus will be on the  FCA 11   to show that a  firm  or other  person 14  has been at fault in some way. What constitutes \"fault\" varies between different  Principles . Under  Principle  1 (Integrity), for example, the  FCA 11   would need to demonstrate a lack of integrity in the conduct of a  firm's  or other  person’s 14  business. Under  Principle  2 (Skill, care and diligence) a  firm  or other  person 14  would be in breach if it was shown to have failed to act with due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of its business. Similarly, under  Principle  3 (Management and control) a  firm  or other  person 14  would not be in breach simply because it failed to control or prevent unforeseeable risks; but a breach would occur if the  firm  or other  person 14  had failed to take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly or effectively."},
{"Section": "Consequences of breaching the Principles", "ID": "PRIN 1.1.8", "Dated": "01/08/2019", "Description": "The  Principles  are also relevant to the  FCA's 15  powers of information-gathering, to vary a  firm's   Part 4A permission  or authorisation or registration under the  Payment Services Regulations  or  Electronic Money Regulations 14 ,  and of investigation and intervention, and provide a basis on which the  FCA 15  may apply to a court for an  injunction  or restitution order or require a  firm  or other  person 14  to make restitution. However, the  Principles  do not give rise to actions for damages by a  private person  (see  PRIN 3.4.4 R )."},
{"Section": "Consequences of breaching the Principles", "ID": "PRIN 1.1.9", "Dated": "01/01/2021", "Description": "Some of the other  rules  and  guidance  in the  Handbook  deal with the bearing of the  Principles  upon particular circumstances. However, since the  Principles  are also designed as a general statement of regulatory requirements applicable in new or unforeseen situations, and in situations in which there is no need for  guidance , the  FCA's 11   other  rules  and  guidance  or  onshored regulations 13  should not be viewed as exhausting the implications of the  Principles  themselves."},
